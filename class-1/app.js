// what is javascript 
// javascript is a single thread and synchronous language

// javascript code Execution
// The execution context in JavaScript is an abstract concept that defines the environment in which code is executed. It is a crucial part of understanding how JavaScript works behind the scenes. Whenever JavaScript code runs, it does so within an execution context. 
// javascript code execute in two phace memory and code and run first memory phase

//Memory 
// The memory phase of the JavaScript execution context is the initial stage where the JavaScript engine sets up the environment for code execution. It is also called the "variable environment".
// memory stage ma variable init phase ma save hota ha our us ke value undifine save hote ha our pher code phase jab chalta ha to us line of code ka chlna ka bade value update ho kar jo apna  value rhakhe ha yo ho gate ha
// memory stage ma funtion key and value ka pere ma pura fuction mathord ke tarha store hotha hota ha like fuction name : pura fuction ka under ka line of code 

//code 
// The code execution phase in which the variables are assigned their value and the code is run line by line .
// The code execution phase update the value to undifine sa actual value .
// The code execution phase function create your own code execution context in which same process . use callstack.


// call stack
// The call stack in JavaScript is a mechanism that tracks the execution of function calls in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner. It's essentially a stack data structure that keeps track of the order in which functions are called.
// When a function is called, it's added to the top of the call stack. When that function finishes executing, it's removed from the stack, and control returns to the function below it. This process continues until the stack is empty, indicating that all function calls have completed.
// The call stack plays a vital role in managing the flow of execution in JavaScript programs. It ensures that functions are executed in the correct order and that control is returned to the appropriate location after each function call.
