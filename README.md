# javascript-Core-Concepts
This repository contains daily learning notes, summaries, and practice related to the core fundamentals of JavaScript.
It covers essential building blocks like execution context, call stack, scoping, hoisting, and other behind-the-scenes concepts that every serious JavaScript developer must understand.

## Purpose
- Daily revision and hands-on practice
- In-depth explanations of how JavaScript actually works
- A growing reference of my personal JavaScript understanding
  
##  Topics Covered class-1
- **Code Execution**  
  JavaScript code runs in two phases â€” memory creation and execution.  
- **Call Stack**  
  It manages function calls in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner.  
- **`undefined` vs `is not defined`**  
  `undefined` means declared but not assigned; `is not defined` means never declared.  
- **Window Object**  
  In browsers, `window` is the global object that holds global variables and functions.
- **Variable Scoping**  
  Scope determines where a variable can be accessed â€” function or block level.
